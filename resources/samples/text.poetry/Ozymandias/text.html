<h3> Ozymandias </h3>
</div>
<div id="poem_sect_first">
<p>
I met a traveller from an antique land<br/>
Who said: "Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br/>
Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,<br/>
Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
</p>

<p>
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br/>
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br/>
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br/>
The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed:
</p>

</div>

<div id="poem_sect_second">
<p>
And on the pedestal these words appear:<br/>
'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:<br/>
Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'<br/>
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br/>
Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare<br/>
The lone and level sands stretch far away."
